# Stupid Intent

I don't really know what "intents" are, but I wanted to try to have a smart contract that would swap for me and anyone can submit the calldata.

It's probably a really bad idea but I wanted to see what would happen on mainnet 

TLDR: I only got someone else to exec the transaction after doing all the work for them by gathering the right calldata, having msg.sender get paid, and paying like $20 bucks haha. 

TODO: actually go learn what intents really are and the research / standards forming around them
